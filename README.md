# Step 1: Project Setup

1. First, I created a project folder on my system.


2. Inside the folder, I created these files:

index.html

style1.css

script.js



3. I also created an image folder to store all images.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 2: Writing HTML (Desktop First)

1. I started by building the desktop layout first.


2. HTML structure was created section by section:

Top strip

Header and navbar

Hero section

Features

Bestseller section

Product cards

Gift and promo sections

Collection section

Testimonials

Footer



3. Semantic HTML tags were used to keep the code clean and readable.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 3: Adding CSS Styling

1. CSS was used to match the design from the PDF:

Fonts

Colors

Spacing

Layout



2. Flexbox and Grid were used to align items properly.


3. Media queries were added for mobile responsiveness.


4. Separate styles were written for desktop and mobile view.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 4: Mobile Layout Handling

1. The same HTML file is used for both desktop and mobile.


2. For mobile view:

Some sections are hidden

Some sections are shown

Some sections change position (up and down)



3. CSS media queries and JavaScript are used to match the mobile PDF layout.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 5: JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used to add basic interactions:

1. Mobile hamburger menu open and close


2. Active state change in bestseller tabs


3. Button click animation

6. Section order change in mobile view



All functionality is written using Vanilla JavaScript.
